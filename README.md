# nordic-noir

Repository for http://nordicnoirtours.dk

## First Steps:

1. Create a branch
2. Install [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install) and use it from the command line
3. Run 'sass --watch scss/:css/'. This will watch for changes in the scss folder and update the css folder. Note*: It mantains file structure

## Library

We will create a css library that we will use across the website for consistency. Everything that is going to be reusable is going to be there. Keep uniques css rules scoped to the page that they are unique to.

Feel free to bring your changes and sugestions
