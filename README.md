# nordic-noir

Repository for http://nordicnoirtours.dk

## First Steps:

1. Clone Repo
2. Create a branch
3. [Install SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install) and use it from the command line
4. Run 'sass --watch scss/:css/'. This will watch for changes in the scss folder and update the css folder. Note*: It mantains folder structure

## Library

We will create a css library that we will use across the website for consistency. Everything that is going to be reusable is going to be there. Keep unique css rules scoped to the page that they are unique to.

The majority of css should be in a file called 'main.scss' generated by the sass engine.
The reason for having the majority of css in one file is for browser caching
The same thing goes with JS. All reusable code should be placed in one file that would be cached by the browser.

Feel free to bring your changes and sugestions

## Custom CSS

If any page uses css that is unique to it keep that piece of css with the page

## JS

Create helper functions in the js folder. Import those script files in the pages when needed.

## Public

Everything that is outside the admin folder is considered public and should not allow for any interaction with the database besides getting data.
The data will be return by a service that is going to connect to the database, get the data, process it, 

## Admin Folder

The admin folder will follow PHP MVC structure and it's going to be kept separate from the public.

It's going to handle administrative database interactions (CRUD).
It's going to offer a user inteface for the administrator.
It's going to offer an overview of dinamic content on the website.


## Assets

The assets folde is going to be global, this means that is going to be used by both the public and from within the admin folder.
